	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) have a long history with the first design studies beginning in the 1950s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. MSRs meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an MSR are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in MSR is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of MSR power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors LWRs.},

	abstract = {Corrosion tests of high temperature alloys, Hastelloy-N, Hastelloy-X, Haynes-230, Inconel-617, and Incoloy-800H were performed in molten fluoride salt, FLiNaK (LiF–NaF–KF:46.5–11.5–42mol\%) with the goal of understanding the corrosion mechanisms and ranking these alloys for their suitability for molten fluoride salt heat exchanger and thermal storage applications. The tests were performed at 850°C for 500h in sealed graphite crucibles under an argon cover gas. Corrosion was noted to occur predominantly by dealloying of Cr from the alloys, an effect that was particularly pronounced at the grain boundaries of these alloys. Weight-loss due to corrosion generally correlated with the initial Cr-content of the alloys, and was consistent with the Cr-content measured in the salts after corrosion tests. Two Cr-free alloys, Ni-201 and Nb–1Zr, were also tested. Ni-201, a nearly pure Ni alloy with minor alloying additions, exhibited good resistance to corrosion, whereas Nb–1Zr alloy exhibited extensive corrosion attack. The graphite crucible may have accelerated the corrosion process by promoting the formation of carbide phases on the walls of the test crucibles, but did not alter the basic corrosion mechanism.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors are liquid fuel reactors so that they are flexible in operation, but they are very different from solid fuel reactors in the approach to safety. This study concentrates on the specific concept named Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). Since this new nuclear technology is in development, safety is an essential point to be considered all along the research and development studies. After a short description of the MSFR systems, necessary to device accidental scenarios, this paper will focus on the decay heat evaluation of such a reactor. Among different contributions, the decay heat of fission products in the MSFR is evaluated to be low (3\% of nominal power), mainly due to the reprocessing during the reactor operation. As a result, the contribution of the actinides is significant (0.5\% of nominal power). However, the decay heat of the fission products is important, and among the different uncertainty sources, the fission yield uncertainties are pointed out. The unprotected loss of heat sink transients are studied in this paper. It appears that slow transients are favorable ({\textgreater}1 min) to minimize the temperature increase of the fuel salt. This work will be the basis of further safety studies as well as an essential parameter for the design of the draining system.},

	abstract = {The MSRE is an 8-MW(th) reactor in which molten fluoride salt at 1200°F circulates through a core of graphite bars. Its purpose was to demonstrate the practicality of the key features of molten-salt power reactors.Operation with 235U (33\% enrichment) in the fuel salt began in June 1965, and by March 1968 nuclear operation amounted to 9000 equivalent full-power hours. The goal of demonstrating reliability had been attained—over the last 15 months of 235U operation the reactor had been critical 80\% of the time. At the end of a 6-month run which climaxed this demonstration, the reactor was shut down and the 0.9 mole\% uranium in the fuel was stripped very efficiently in an on-site fluorination facility. Uranium-233 was then added to the carrier salt, making the MSRE the world's first reactor to be fueled with this fissile material. Nuclear operation was resumed in October 1968, and over 2500 equivalent full-power hours have now been produced with 233U.The MSRE has shown that salt handling in an operating reactor is quite practical, the salt chemistry is well behaved, there is practically no corrosion, the nuclear characteristics are very close to predictions, and the system is dynamically stable. Containment of fission products has been excellent and maintenance of radioactive components has been accomplished without unreasonable delay and with very little radiation exposure.The successful operation of the MSRE is an achievement that should strengthen confidence in the practicality of the molten-salt reactor concept.},
