  \frametitle{Conclusions}
        \begin{itemize}
        
        \item Nuclear is the cleanest, cheapest source of energy.
        
        \item Without novel technology, solar and wind are deployed in a 1:2 ratio.
        
        \item H$_2$ and wind can meet I$^2$CNER goals at high cost.
        
        \item Highest impact (so far): nuclear, offshore wind, photocatalytic H$_2$, solar.
 
        \end{itemize}
