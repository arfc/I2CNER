  % a comment
        \begin{itemize}
        
         \item Focus entirely on \textbf{electricity supply sector}.      
         
         \item Cost of fossil fuels, geothermal, hydropower, steam reforming and nuclear is constant.
         
         \item Area cost not taken into account.
         
         \item Emissions tied to energy production, not capacity installation.
         
         \item Annual time-step cannot capture seasonal/daily variation in wind, solar (however annually averaged availability factors are incorporated).
        
        \end{itemize}
