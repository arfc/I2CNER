These countries are working to balance the energy demand and supply. For finding the solution are researched, researches should be attempted to present a more efficient way to use energy as well as renewable energy resources effectively. Photovoltaic energy power systems take place as the most dominant source among renewable energy technologies. The most important reason is that it is unlimited and clean energy of the solar power systems. Many studies show that photovoltaic power systems will have an important share in the electricity of the future. In this study, to generate electricity from solar energy using photovoltaic systems have a leading position in some European countries, United States of America, China and Japan's current status and future policies will be analyzed in various comments were made.},

	title = {Overview of {Assessment} by {Power} {Generation} {Cost} {Verification} {Working} {Group}},
	abstract = {This report outlines the assessment by the Power Generation Cost Verification Working Group organized in the Japanese government in 2015. The working group sought to assess nuclear, thermal (fossil fuel-fired) and renewable energy power generation costs in Japan as fairly as possible while considering the latest data made available after the previous estimation by the Cost Estimation and Review Committee in 2011 and revising estimation methods. The 2011 Committee estimated the unit cost for nuclear power generation at 8.9 yen/kWh or more (with the discount rate at 3\% and the capacity factor at 70\%) covering decommissioning, additional safety measures, reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels, disposal of high-level radioactive wastes, plant location, R\&D and accident risks. The working group revised the estimate upward to 10.1 yen/kWh or more reflecting additional damage compensation and safety measure costs after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident. The unit power generation cost estimate was also raised for fossil fuels due to exchange rate and other changes and for most renewable energy sources due to additional policy costs, while the estimate for solar photovoltaics was lowered due to an actual decline in solar panel prices. Given that the results change depending on preconditions, it is important to assess the economic efficiency of each power source not only by comparing numerical estimates alone, but also by understanding the changes in the estimates.},

This chapter discusses the latest development in the global market. It also explores the potential for growth in not only the aforementioned geographic areas, but also other, yet unexplored, opportunities.},
