  \frametitle{Assumptions}

  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item New Nuclear = Advanced Boiling Water Reactors.
  
  \item Simplistic, conservative assumption about demand growth = +1.7\% per year.
  
  \item Nuclear, wind, solar annual growth rate \textbf{limits} based on trends in USA, China, Japan.
  
  \item CCS: Available for deployment in 2030, costs reduce by 2050.
  
  \item Offshore and onshore wind capacity limited to theoretical potential (about 450 GW and 200 GW respectively).
  
  \item H$_2$: Steam reforming available in 2030, photocatalytic conversion in 2050.
  
  \item Hydropower, geothermal capacity held constant.
  
  \end{itemize}
