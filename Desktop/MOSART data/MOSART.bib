A completely coupled model is needed since in some fast reactors designs, the velocity pattern could be very complicated and strongly affected by the neutron dynamics via the heat source from fission reactions. Furthermore, the neutron dynamics is strongly affected by the thermohydrodynamics via the motion of precursors and by feedback effects. The methods typical of solid fuel reactors of previous generations are not sufficient to handle these more highly coupled concepts. In the preset paper, we consider the coupling between neutronics and thermohydrodynamics with simple but realistic hypotheses assumed to model the evolution of all the variables involved in the calculation. The numerical scheme used represents the current state of the art in the solution of non-linear systems: the Newton–Krylov algorithm. Several calculations are presented to demonstrate the ability of the methods described here to study the behavior of molten salt reactors in both steady state and transient situations.},

	abstract = {An OpenMC/TANSY code system has been developed in this paper for the coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics simulations of MSRs. The homogenized cross section data library is generated using the continuous-energy Monte-Carlo code OpenMC which provides significant modeling flexibility compared against the traditional deterministic lattice transport codes. The few-group cross sections generated by OpenMC are provided to TANSY which is based on OpenFOAM to perform the full-core coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics simulations. In order to verify the OpenMC/TANSY code system, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor benchmark problem was calculated and both the neutronics results and thermal-hydraulics results were compared with those obtained by other researchers. For application of the OpenMC/TANSY codes sequence, the simulation of a representative molten salt reactor core MOSART has been performed. First, to verify the generation of the few-group cross sections, the neutronics results obtained by the “two-step” scheme were compared with those obtained by full-core Monte-Carlo solution. Good agreement can be observed for the multiplication factor as well as the power distributions. Then the full-core coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics simulation was performed. The distribution of the important neutronics and thermal-hydraulics parameters are presented and analyzed in detailed in this paper. For the further study of the characteristics of MSRs, several effects like the external-loop transit time, inlet velocity and inlet temperature on the effective delayed neutron fraction and critical fuel concentration have been analyzed. The numerical results indicated that the TANSY code with the cross section library generated by OpenMC has the capability for the steady-state analysis and reactor core design of MSRs.},

The fundamental models and numerical method are established in this paper, based on which a home-made software COUPLE is coded to perform the characteristics analysis for liquid-fuel MSRs. The software is applied to the MOSART (MOlten Salt Actinide Recycler and Transmuter) conceptual analysis, and the space distributions of the neutron fluxes and the delayed neutron precursors, and the effects of the main operation parameters on the effective multiplication factor are obtained. The results indicate that the liquid-fuel flow influences the delayed neutron precursors significantly, while affects the neutron fluxes slightly, and the MOSART shows good inherent safety characteristics.},

In the present study, a spatial kinetic model taking the fuel flow effects into account for liquid-fuel reactors is derived without approximation from the time–space-dependent equations of neutrons and delayed neutron precursors. The relation between such spatial kinetic model and the point kinetic model for the solid-fuel reactor is set up as well, which is useful for extending the safety codes developed for conventional solid-fuel reactors to liquid-fuel ones. The spatial kinetic model together with the other two approximated kinetic models are applied to the safety analysis of a typical liquid-fuel reactor MOSART (MOlten Salt Actinide Recycler and Transmuter). The steady state calculation and the ULOF (Unprotected Loss of Flow) calculation are performed, and the liquid-fuel flow effects are studied particularly. The steady state results show that the fuel flow influences the distributions of the delayed neutron precursors significantly. The ULOF results by all models show that the behavior of the relative power, fuel salt temperature, graphite temperature, and reactivity feedbacks are similar due to strong negative reactivity feedbacks. However, the developed spatial kinetic model obtains more safety margin to the fuel temperature limit.},

This study concentrates on the specific concept named Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). Since this new nuclear technology is in development, safety is an essential point to be considered all along the research and development studies. After a short description of the MSFR systems, necessary to device accidental scenarios, this paper will focus on the decay heat evaluation of such a reactor. Among different contributions, the decay heat of fission products in the MSFR is evaluated to be low (3\% of nominal power), mainly due to the reprocessing during the reactor operation. As a result, the contribution of the actinides is significant (0.5\% of nominal power). However, the decay heat of the fission products is important, and among the different uncertainty sources, the fission yield uncertainties are pointed out. The unprotected loss of heat sink transients are studied in this paper. It appears that slow transients are favorable ({\textgreater}1 min) to minimize the temperature increase of the fuel salt. This work will be the basis of further safety studies as well as an essential parameter for the design of the draining system.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor (MSR), which is one of the ‘Generation IV’ concepts, can be used for transmutation, and production of electricity, hydrogen and fissile fuels. In this study, a single-liquid-fueled MSR is designed for conceptual research, in which no solid material is present in the core as moderator, except for the external reflector. The fuel salt flow makes the MSR neutronics different from that of conventional reactors using solid fuels, and couples the flow and heat transfer strongly. Therefore, it is necessary to study the core characteristics with due attention to the coupling among flow, heat transfer and neutronics. The standard turbulent model is adopted to establish the flow and heat transfer model, while the diffusion theory is used for the neutronics model, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for fast and thermal neutron fluxes, and balance equations for six groups of delayed neutron precursors. These two models which are coupled through the temperature and heat source are coded in a microcomputer program. The distributions of the velocity, temperature, neutron fluxes, and delayed neutron precursors under the rated condition are obtained. In addition, the effects of the inflow temperature, inflow velocity, and the fuel salt residence time out of the core are discussed in detail. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of the new generation molten salt reactors.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) can be used as effective burners of plutonium (Pu) and minor actinides (MAs) from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel. In this paper a study was made to examine the thermal hydraulic behaviour of the conceptual design of the molten salt advanced reactor transmuter (MOSART) [Ignatiev, V., Feynberg, O., Myasnikov, A., Zakirov, R., 2003a. Neutronic properties and possible fuel cycle of a molten salt transmuter. Proceedings of the 2003 ANS/ENS International Winter Meeting (GLOBAL 2003), Hyatt Regency, New Orleans, LA, USA 16–20 November 2003]. The molten salt fuel is a ternary NaF–LiF–BeF2 system fuelled with ca. 1 mol\% typical compositions of transuranium-trifluorides (PuF3, etc.) from light water reactor spent fuel. The MOSART reactor core does not contain graphite structure elements to guide the flow, so the neutron spectrum is rather hard in order to improve the burning performance. Without those structure elements in the core, the molten salt in core flows freely and the flow pattern could be potentially complicated and may affect significantly the fuel temperature distribution in the core. Therefore, some optimizations of the salt flow pattern may be needed. Here, the main attention has been paid to the fluid dynamic simulations of the MOSART core with the code SIMMER-III [Kondo, Sa., Morita, K., Tobita, Y., Shirakawa, K., 1992. SIMMER-III: an advanced computer program for LMFBR severe accident analysis.

Current status and validation of the SIMMER-III LMFR safety analysis code. Proceedings of the ICONE-7, Tokyo, Japan], which was originally developed for the safety assessment of sodium-cooled fast reactors and recently extended by the authors for the thermo-hydraulic and neutronic models so as to describe the molten salt reactors. For the adaptation to molten salt reactor, a complete equation of state (EOS) for this liquid fuel had to be developed and implemented into the SIMMER-III code. Through those simulations it was concluded that the thermal hydraulic behaviour appeared to be very important in molten salt reactors concerning design, operation and safety. A flow distribution plate design was found effective to optimize the flow pattern in the core region. Further investigations are under way to obtain optimal flow fields without exceeding design limits.},

The circulating-fuel in the can-type molten salt fast reactor makes the neutronics and thermo-hydraulics of the reactor strongly coupled and different from that of traditional solid-fuel reactors. In the present paper, a new coupling model is presented that physically describes the inherent relations between the neutron flux, the delayed neutron precursor, the heat transfer and the turbulent flow. Based on the model, integrating nuclear data processing, CAD modeling, structured and unstructured mesh technology, data analysis and visualization application, a three dimension steady state simulation code system (MSR3DS) for the can-type molten salt fast reactor is developed and validated. In order to demonstrate the ability of the code, the three dimension distributions of the velocity, the neutron flux, the delayed neutron precursor and the temperature were obtained for the simplified MOlten Salt Advanced Reactor Transmuter (MOSART) using this code. The results indicate that the MSR3DS code can provide a feasible description of multi-physical coupling phenomena in can-type molten salt fast reactor. Furthermore, the code can well predict the flow effect of fuel salt and the transport effect of the turbulent diffusion.},

	abstract = {A study is under progress to examine the feasibility of MOlten Salt Actinide Recycler and Transforming (MOSART) system without and with U–Th support fuelled with different compositions of transuranic elements (TRU) trifluorides from spent LWR fuel. New design options with homogeneous core and fuel salt with high enough solubility for transuranic elements trifluorides are being examined because of new goals. The paper has the main objective of presenting the fuel cycle flexibility of the MOSART system while accounting technical constrains and experimental data received in this study. A brief description is given of the experimental results on key physical and chemical properties of fuel salt and combined materials compatibility to satisfy MOSART system requirements.},
